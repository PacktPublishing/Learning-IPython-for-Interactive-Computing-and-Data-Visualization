## About the Video Course
This course is a beginner-friendly guide to the Python data analysis platform. After an introduction to the Python language, IPython, and Jupyter Notebook, you will learn how to analyze and visualize data on real-world examples, how to create graphical user interfaces for image processing in Notebook, and how to perform fast numerical computations for scientific simulations with NumPy, Numba, Cython, and ipyparallel. By the end of this course, you will be able to perform in-depth analyses of all sorts of data.
